# This program uses a simple interface to keep trak of daycare funds, hours, and payments.
# Using SQLite the program can make relationships between parents, children, and employees.
# Amounts owed, rates, and hours can be displayed on the interface or can be exported to a CSV file 
# to keep past records.  At the end of the week (or any time for that matter) the user can clear
# the hours and payments for the week, while leaving child and parent information still in the database.
